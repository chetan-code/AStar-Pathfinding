# AStar-Pathfinding
# A star (A*) pathfinding in unity C#
>A* is an informed search algorithm, or a best-first search, meaning that it is formulated in terms of weighted graphs: starting from a specific starting node of a graph, it aims >to find a path to the given goal node having the smallest cost (least distance travelled, shortest time, etc.). It does this by maintaining a tree of paths originating at the >start node and extending those paths one edge at a time until its termination criterion is satisfied.
